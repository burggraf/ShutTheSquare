## Development Workflow

1. **Design Phase**: Following comprehensive PRD specifications
2. **Implementation**: Using Unity 6.1 with mobile-first approach  
3. **Testing**: Cross-platform testing on iOS and Android devices
4. **Deployment**: Through Unity Cloud Build and platform stores

## Next Development Phase

Once mobile modules are installed:
1. Configure iOS and Android build settings
2. Set up Unity Gaming Services project
3. Implement dice rolling mechanics with shake detection
4. Create 4-sided board game logic
5. Develop multiplayer turn management
6. Build UI for mobile touch interactions

## Tools and Environment
